# 3D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) Electromagnetic Simulator

## Project Overview
This project implements a **3D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) Electromagnetic Simulator**, which is a numerical tool used to solve Maxwellâ€™s equations for electromagnetic wave propagation in three dimensions over time. This simulator is specifically designed to analyze the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in various media.

## Project Structure
Here is a breakdown of the key files in the project:

### Main Simulation Files:
1. **Main.m**  
   - This is the main script that sets up the simulation, initializes parameters, and runs the time-stepping loop to compute the evolution of electromagnetic fields.
  
2. **Display_FDTD_Slice.m**  
   - This script visualizes the slices of the electric and magnetic fields in the simulation at specified coordinates and times.

### Initialization Files:
1. **Initialize_FFTKernel.m**  
   - Sets up the kernel required for the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) used in the analysis of the frequency domain.

2. **Initialize_FFTParameters.m**  
   - Configures parameters needed for performing FFT on the fields.

3. **Initialize_PhysicalConstants.m**  
   - Defines the necessary physical constants such as the speed of light and permittivity of free space.

4. **Initialize_PlotParameters.m**  
   - Sets up parameters for controlling plot settings, including visualization preferences for the field data.

5. **Initialize_Ports.m**  
   - Initializes the source and receiving ports for electromagnetic wave input and output in the simulation.

6. **Initialize_SourceParameters.m**  
   - Sets up the parameters for the source, including waveform type and location.

### Field Update Functions:
1. **Update_CurlE.m**  
   - Updates the curl of the electric field based on the magnetic field components and grid spacing.

2. **Update_CurlH.m**  
   - Updates the curl of the magnetic field based on the electric field components.

3. **Update_DField.m**  
   - Updates the displacement field, which is an intermediate step in updating the electric field.

4. **Update_EField.m**  
   - Updates the electric field components at each time step based on the displacement field.

5. **Update_HField.m**  
   - Updates the magnetic field components at each time step based on the curl of the electric field.

6. **Update_Source.m**  
   - Updates the source input for the simulation, which can be a Gaussian pulse, sinusoid, chirp, or constant DC.

### Additional Data and Documentation:
- **Blank_Model_and_Initialized_parameters.mat**  
   - A MATLAB `.mat` file that stores pre-initialized model parameters and settings.
  
- **FDTD Study (Normalize E).pdf**  
   - A PDF document discussing the normalization of Maxwell's equations for the FDTD method and its application to your project.

## How to Run the Simulation
1. Ensure all files are placed in the same directory.
2. Open MATLAB and run the `Main.m` script.
3. The simulation will display slices of the electric and magnetic fields at each time step, allowing real-time visualization of the field propagation.

## Key Features
- **Time-domain simulation** of Maxwell's equations using the FDTD method.
- Supports visualization of 3D slices of electric and magnetic fields.
- Configurable source types, including Gaussian, sinusoidal, chirp, and DC signals.
- Includes stability checks based on the Courant condition.

## Customization
- Modify the source parameters by adjusting the settings in `Initialize_SourceParameters.m`.
- Change the physical constants or simulation grid by editing `Initialize_PhysicalConstants.m` and `Initialize_PlotParameters.m`.
- Use different visualization options by configuring `Display_FDTD_Slice.m`.
